    "description": "Throws Isaac's head, allowing him to shoot from the spot it lands. The head will block enemy shots and deal contact damage. The body cannot shoot tears while the head is detached.\r\nThe head does 24 damage on impact and 4 damage per tick (12 per second) while on the ground.\r\nThe head can return to Isaac by touching it, or by using the item again which won't waste charges. Both throwing and retaking the head deals 24 damage to enemies passing through.\r\nHas a 1% chance of being dropped upon defeating Chimera."
